# Human_LifeSpan_Factors
In this project, I examined the data, based on the data set, about known factors affecting how long humans live. I filtered/queried only for factors with a strong or good scientific backing. With that, I ranked the positive and negative affecting factors and cleaned for contradictions in the data.
